PCOS Detector is a symptom-based web application that helps identify the risk of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using machine learning.
Users input basic health data—like menstrual cycle patterns, BMI, and symptoms such as acne or hair growth—and the app predicts their likelihood of having PCOS.

Built using Python and Streamlit, it provides a quick, accessible, and private screening tool, especially useful for early awareness and for those without immediate access to healthcare professionals.


The application is still in progress.
The functionalities that are implemented.
1. Building the Pcos detection model.
2. Building the basic UI of the homepage and other pages.
3. Building the database to store user details.
4. Using firebase for the authentication and managing session.

Functionalities to be added:
1. Period tracker for efficient detection.
2. Efficiently storing user's details.
3. Improving the accuracy of the model.
